The OpenAI API key is required to connect our app to the API endpoints. It'll enable us to retrieve generative responses. Follow the instructions below.
Navigate to the OpenAI website.
Click Log in or Sign up in the top navigation bar.
If successful, you'll be redirected to the OpenAI platform.
Navigate to the API keys section and generate a new secret key.
Remember to specify the correct API key, otherwise responses will not be generated.
